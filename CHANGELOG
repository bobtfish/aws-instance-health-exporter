0.0.3
 - Add caching of results to reduce query load on AWS.

   There's no point in re-querying the AWS API for data about events
   that will happen in a few days time every few seconds to scrape.
   Therefore caching has been implemented - this will stop concurrent
   queries (only hitting the API once) by default, but can be turned
   up to only query the API once every <duration>.

   I only want to get the instance statuses from the AWS API
   every 10m, but Prometheus needs to sample data every 2m to
   maintain contiguous time series (strictly only every 5m,
   but you want to scrape at least 2x this often to allow
   for the occasional missed/failed scrape).

0.0.2
